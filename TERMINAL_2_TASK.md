# 🎨 TERMINAL 2 - UI REDESIGN TASK

## Your Mission
Transform the UI from generic "AI-generated" look to a professional, unique design that stands out.

## Copy This Prompt Into Terminal 2:
```
I'm working on a file conversion platform. The backend is complete with 100+ conversions working. 
I need you to completely redesign the UI to look professional and unique - NOT like a typical AI-generated interface.

Current files to redesign:
- frontend/index.html (structure improvements)
- frontend/css/style.css (complete visual overhaul)
- frontend/js/ui.js (enhanced interactions)

Requirements:
1. **Unique Color Scheme** - NOT generic blue/purple gradients. Be creative!
2. **Professional Typography** - Use modern font pairings, proper hierarchy
3. **Custom Layout** - Not just a centered box. Think creative but usable.
4. **Smooth Animations** - Micro-interactions, hover effects, transitions
5. **Dark Mode Toggle** - Modern dark/light theme switch
6. **File Type Icons** - Visual indicators for different formats
7. **Better Upload Area** - Make drag-and-drop area more engaging
8. **Progress Animation** - Creative loading states
9. **Success States** - Celebratory animations when conversion completes
10. **Mobile Responsive** - Works perfectly on all devices

Design Inspiration:
- Think Stripe, Linear, Vercel - clean, modern, professional
- NOT like typical bootstrap/tailwind templates
- Unique personality while staying professional
